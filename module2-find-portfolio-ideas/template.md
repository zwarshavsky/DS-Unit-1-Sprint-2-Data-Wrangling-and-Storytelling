# Ideas for data storytelling

## You

What do you care about?

Audio analysis, music identification, and solving challanges related to my acoustic consulting enterprise are at the top of my list. I want to come up with unique insights in the pre-propocessing, live processing, and reinforcement technology space and somewhere down the road, algorithms that can improve the quality and efficiency of current sound system hardware.     


What do you know about?

I have a junior understanding of electricity and acoustics. A deep understanding of music genres, and a junor understanding of musical theory. I know about project management and agile software development. 

I know about the sound system design space and sound system technology. 


What decisions do you face?

* How to identify potential venues that have noise complaints that would be interested in the acoustic optimization and sound system install services of my organization. (I have a dataset to analyze that would specifically address this).

* Who is applying for permits to build new venues in NYC? Are those people reachable?

* What is the probability of market penetration / disruption with my subwoofer product?



## Seven templates

Training Kit (https://learn.lambdaschool.com/ds/module/recedjanlbpqxic2r) explains the seven templates from Priceonomics.

Can you apply the templates to your topics? 

1. Geographic Variation

Absolutely available for the first of two points above. 

2. Trend related to the news

Would be very useful to scrape news sources for these insights! 


3. Who does that?

* My company or any soundproofing or acoustic consulting service. 
* My company or any soundsystem install or rental company. 
* My company or any other soundsystem design company. 


4. Answering a question people care about

How do 311 complaints impact the longevity of a business? Not sure it's cocktail party worthy.  


5. Valuable to businesses

The answer is simply yes! 


6. What's the most popular?

What establishment gets the most noise complaints?
Which entity or contruction group handles most of the venues?

7. Cost/Money rankings

N/A


## Misconceptions

What misconceptions do people have about your topic?

That 311 Noise complaints are merely the status quo for event spaces and that this can't be solved. 


## Examples

What data storytelling example inspires you?

https://insights.spotify.com/us/2017/05/24/how-students-listen-2017/


Could you do a new hypothesis, for the same question?

For noise complaints, I would ask has there been a trend for more or less complaints in gentrifying neighborhoods?

For the spotify story, what time of the day are people listening to what genres. A fun infographic. 


Could you do a new question, for the same topic?

New question: 311 complaints proximity to high income per capita. 

New question: Genre vs political leaning. 


Could you do a new topic, with the same "style"?

Difficult time with this one. 


## Data

Where could you search for data about your topic?

Noise complaints: https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Social-Services/311-Service-Requests-from-2010-to-Present/erm2-nwe9

# Assignment!

Fill out the above template *twice*, for two different ideas.

Then compare and contrast and select one as the idea you're leaning towards
working on for your project week.

Both of the idea above have merit. The Million songs dataset has more application for my ultimate goal of working strictly with MIR (Music Information Retrieval), however the 311 noise complaints data analysis would be more applicable as a portfolio pice with greater application (in the short term) for business use. I am leaning towards the 311 Noise Complaints.
